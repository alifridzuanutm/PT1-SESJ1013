## Course Overview

- **Course Name:** Programming Technique 1
- **Course Code:** SESJ1013
- **Level:** Undergraduate
- **Duration:** 14 weeks
- **Instructor:** [Instructor Name]
- **Contact:** [Instructor Email]

## Course Description

Programming Technique 1 is an introductory course designed for undergraduate students to develop essential programming skills and cultivate problem-solving abilities. This course focuses on foundational programming concepts, principles, and techniques using a selected programming language (e.g., Python). Students will gain proficiency in designing, coding, and debugging programs, all while building a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking and software development practices.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Comprehend fundamental programming concepts and terminology.
- Implement programs in a specific programming language (e.g., Python) to address basic computational challenges.
- Analyze problems and devise algorithmic solutions.
- Create code utilizing control structures such as loops and conditional statements.
- Develop modular code using functions and adhere to sound programming practices.
- Exhibit competence in debugging and rectifying code errors.
- Apply coding conventions, including code documentation and formatting.
- Collaborate effectively on programming assignments and projects.

## Assessment Methods

Student progress will be evaluated through a combination of the following methods:

- **Assignments:** Regular programming assignments will gauge students' grasp of concepts and their ability to write functional code for given problems.
- **Quizzes:** Periodic quizzes will assess students' understanding of theoretical concepts, syntax, and problem-solving techniques.
- **Midterm Exam:** A comprehensive midterm exam will cover material taught in the first half of the course.
- **Final Project:** A substantial programming project will challenge students to design and implement a solution for a real-world problem.
- **Final Exam:** A cumulative final exam will evaluate students' overall comprehension of the course content.
