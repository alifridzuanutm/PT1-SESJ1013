- hii my name is Adriana Munirah Binti Adiekhasmadmajar, but you can just call me Adriana or Ad for short.
- I'm from Johor Bahru, Johor.
- I used to study at SMK Sultan Ismail, JB and I pursued to Kolej Matrikulasi Johor before further my studies now at UTM.
- My hobby is listening to music. I enjoyed hearing any type of songs even in different language and sometimes I like to dance too.
- I can speak 3 languages, Bahasa Malaysia, English and Japanese language. But I'm not the best in Japanese language now since last I learned it in my highschool.
